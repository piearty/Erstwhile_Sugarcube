If you have the memories, "Bram realizing the wolfsbane was tampered with" and "the detective ruminating about the murder weapon", you can combine Salad with Wolfbane, Leaves, or Aconite Poison to get the final memory and true murder:

Terry poisoning your salad

***The other items***
Some of the items, such as the Rap Sheet, cannot be combined with any other items to unlock memories. They all have the same statement on them indicating as such, and you can set them aside using the feature. Don't ignore them though; there's mysteries in this game aside from who the killer is.
