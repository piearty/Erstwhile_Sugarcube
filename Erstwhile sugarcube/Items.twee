<h3>Justin's Testimony</h3>
"Well, we - the RNA - planned out this big, neighborhood Thanksgiving feast a couple weeks before the day itself. Things were going well, related to the dinner anyway, and everyone who could was helping cook and such. I didn't because I was busy, but..."

"Yeah, `[I was busy with]` patrols, talks with schools, //more// patrols...I mean. You know how it is."

"Mort wasn't helping out because he was also busy with RNA matters. Apparently." He mutters the last word.

"So when we met on Thanksgiving day at Annie's place to touch base, he got all angry that there were nuts in every dish that'd been cooked. Some nut allergy. I - I had no idea.

"Annie and he had some sort of fight, since she had created the menu...That happened before the dinner. Kinda turned everything sour from the start. Thinking about Mort sitting and eating nothing, well, even I felt sorry for him. So the wife suggested we get him a salad. Sure. We forgot dressing though, so she had me go back to get it.

"Then we prepared for the dinner for a couple hours, it started, and...well.

"I hope you all find the killer soon and bring them to justice. I didn't exactly call Mort a friend - I - to be completely honest I didn't like him very much, but I-" He clears his throat. "I never wished him dead."\

<h3>Terry's Testimony</h3>
"I-I just can't believe - I'm - oh my word I can't do this. Sorry, I need a minute..." She takes a shaky breath and fans herself. "It's just, I never, I never thought that - Mort of all people!

"Sorry yes, what happened...t-the dinner. W-well, the RNA thought up the idea a while ago. A big feast. E-everyone was so excited! Mort, Justin, and I didn't cook but we were all pitching in in some way. B-but then - we found out M-Mort couldn't eat the food - any of it! And to find out day of too, oh, can you imagine? So Justin -  he's been my rock through all of this bless him - he thought to get Mort a salad. Bless Justin honestly, bless him, I donâ€™t know what I'd do if he wasn't there for me -

"Sorry, right...

"Yes, we drove to the grocery to get a small salad for Mort. It was the least we could do so the poor man could have something to eat...poor Mort, oh!

"We headed to the park after that... to help set up, you know? When the dinner started, before the poor man could die of hunger, we gave Mort our salad - oh, and Annie, she gave him a sandwich. Then Erin...Erin gave him a silly little potion, going on and on about protection or something. He drank it, though I can't imagine why, and well...! Next thing you know he's d-dead on the floor!

"That girl, I just - she has no idea what she's doing with her so-called magic, I wouldn't be surprised if drinking that finally...oh I don't want to think about it! But she's done terrible things before...regardless, whoever did it should be ashamed..."\

<h3>Erin's Testimony</h3>
"I knew this would happen...

"See, the association came up with the idea for the dinner, and everyone was really excited, but there was a negative aura in the air, I could feel it.

"`[Why?]` Well I think that's obvious.

"Well, earlier today while the RNA was meeting, Annie and Mort got into a quarrel. We'd baked everything the day before- Annie, Bram, and I, and for some reason Mort didn't like it. There was a bad aura around everyone beforehand, but then it got really bad at the meeting. Annie's aura flared up, and of course everyone loves Annie so everyone else got frustrated-

"Well, Mort didn't want to eat any of the dishes- couldn't? He said something like that.  I kept trying to give him the potion, but he ignored me! Everyone ignores me. He left all angrily, and then Justin and Terry went off to get Mort something, salad maybe? I didn't pay too much attention. Well, I did, but not because I was stalking them or anything. I was just concerned about Justin. He hasn't been talking to me at all. I tried to tell him about the bad energies and signs I've felt lately, but he wouldn't listen, and then this had to go and happen!

"Anyway, we all set up the dinner for a couple hours. Then I gave Mort the potion at the party. I watched him drink it and then went back to the party, feeling better, until...

"I had prepared the potion for Mort because I thought he was in danger, and I was right.
                      
"Ingredients that protect `[were in the potion]`, of course.

"I thought the potion would work. It was supposed to protect him, though I guess he never did want my protection."\

<h3>Annie's Testimony</h3>
"I guess it coulda been `[a good day]`, but there's a dead man. Did you forget that or somethin'?

"Where are we startin'? We fought this morning...

"Well, all of yesterday Erin, Bram, and I were baking. Justin couldn't make it, busy as always, and Terry is a terrible cook. Mort was no help. If he'd been there we wouldn't have had -

"I was getting `[to the fight]`, officer. If he'd been there we wouldn't have had the fight. He was sayin' he wouldn't eat the food, and naturally I took offense to that, I mean, spendin' hours in the kitchen cookin' just to have your friend refuse because he don't like nuts!

"Now, if only he'd helped he coulda said that while we were baking. //Before// I put the nuts in everything. And after Justin said it'd be fine, encouraged me even...hmph.

"I couldn't just let the man starve. After we exchanged some fighting words, I made him a sandwich. Everyone else went off to the party- except Justin and Terry. They went to the store.

"I gave `[the sandwich]` to Mort, of course. Why would I make a sandwich to feed a man and not give it to him?" She paused. "I wish we'd made up. Feels wrong to have ill thoughts of the dead."\

"Well, there was the party. And, oh! Before that was the meeting, and I guess the baking the day before. Mort wasn't there though, so where should I start, officer? I don't want to slow you down with irrelevant info, ha.

"O-okay. Well, yesterday, we were all baking. Erin, Annie, and I, that is. There were a lot of nuts in everything, which was Justin's idea apparently- I don't know if Justin knew about the allergy, of course! Anyway, that's why Mort started the fight with Annie. Today, at the meeting, I mean. Not yesterday. It's like she doesn't know what allergies are.

"Mort left, which was really uncomfortable, but we tried to finish the meeting anyway. Then we all went to the party. Or the store. Or the kitchen. I went to the party to set up.

"B-before you start asking about the wolfsbane in the greenhouse, Erin asked me to plant it. She uses it for spells. But I wasn't growing it to poison Mort!

"W-wait, what are you writing down? I said I wasn't - "
